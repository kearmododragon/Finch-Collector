Part 2 
1. Create a Finch model with at least three attributes.
2. Using the Python Interactive Shell (`python3 manage.py shell`), create some finches in your database to be rendered on the page.
    
    > Don't forget to import your Finch model
    > 
3. Register the Finch model with the admin portal in `admin.py`.
4. Implement the following User Stories:
    - AAU, when I visit the `All Finches` page, I want to view a list of all finches **from the database** (index view) that displays each of the attributes of a finch.
    - AAU, when I click on a finch card on the index page, I want to be taken to a details page where I can see all attributes of the finch.
