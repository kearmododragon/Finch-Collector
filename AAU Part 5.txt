Part 5 [HUNGRY FOR MORE, NOT ESSENTIAL]

1. Create another model that will have a Many:Many relationship with your main data entity.
    - Don't forget to add a ManyToManyField on one of the Models.
2. Add at least the ability to Create the new model. Refer to how Cat Collector used CBV's to implement full-CRUD with very little code in **[views.py](http://views.py/)**. Don't forget to add the additional routes in **[urls.py](http://urls.py/)** and the necessary templates.
3. Implement similar functionality to the Toy model in catcollector, including the following User Stories:
    - AAU, I want to see a list displaying all of the toys in the database. (Step 2 above)
    - AAU, I want to be able to add a Toy to list of Toys. (Step 2 above)
    - AAU, when I visit the `detail` page for a finch, I want to see a list of toys belonging to the finch, and also any available toys that I can add to the finch.
