- AAU, I want to be able to navigate to separate pages for `About` and `All Finches` using a navbar
- AAU, when I visit the `About` page, I want to view some details about the finchcollector application.
- AAU, when I visit the `All Finches` page, I want to view a list of all finches (index view) that displays each of the attributes of a finch.
